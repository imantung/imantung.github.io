## 5 seconds rule

<https://melrobbins.com/five-elements-5-second-rule/>

- You are one decision away from a completely different life
- You canâ€™t control how you feel. But you can always choose how you act.
- I was the problem and in five seconds, I could push myself and become the solution.
- If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it
