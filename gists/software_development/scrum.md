Scrum vs Kanban
|  | SCRUM | KANBAN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cadence | Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks) | Continuous flow |
| Release methodology |	At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner |	Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion |
| Roles | Product owner, scrum master, development team |	No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach. |
| Key metrics |	Velocity | Cycle time |
| Change philosophy	| Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. Doing so compromises learnings around estimation. |	Change can happen at any time |

7 waste of software development
1. Partially Done Work: Any feature put on hold, wastes time already invested and makes the codebase less maintainable.
2. Extra Processes: Any step in your process that doesn’t add value. Such as documentation that isn’t read or additional rubber stamping.
3. Extra Features: Low value features, those that are not used or only used infrequently.
4. Task Switching: Switching tasks reduces efficiency. The fastest way to complete two things is to do one at a time.
5. Waiting: Time lost while waiting to start such as approval delays and dependencies.
6. Motion: Time lost moving artefacts or data from one location to another or hunting for information on wikis.
7. Defects: The cost of fixing defects and the impact of re-work on the bottom line.

## 1. Sprint planning

Style:
- Velocity driven
- Capacity driven

Activity
- Decide Sprint Goal
- List down Sprint Backlog
- Capacity Planning (Team Leave plan)

## 2. Daily Scrum or Stand Up
- Dit it yesterday?
- Will do it today? 
- Any impediment?

## 3. Backlog Grooming/Refinement

Ref:
- https://vitalitychicago.com/blog/improving-product-backlog-refinement/

`Definition of Ready`: all the things that a backlog item must meet in order to be “ready” to take into the sprint
- Business Value
- Clear understanding of who/what/why
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies identified/defined
- Constraint identified/defined

Activity:
- Removing PBIs that no longer appear relevant
- Creating new PBIs in response to newly discovered needs
- Re-assessing the relative priority of PBIs
- Assigning estimates to PBIs which have yet to receive one
- Correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information
- Splitting PBIs which are high priority but too coarse grained to fit in an upcoming iteration
- Adding acceptance criteria

## 4. Sprint review

- Product demo

## 5. Sprint retrospective
- What worked Well?
- What could be improved?
- What will we commit to doing in the next iteration?
- Actionable commitment?
