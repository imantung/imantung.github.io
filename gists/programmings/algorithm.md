## Complexity analysis (Time & Space)

Ref:
- [Big-O Cheatsheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

[Asymptopic Notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation):
- Big-O/Big-Oh/Big-Omicron: no more than
- Big-Omega: at least
- Big-Theta: as much as (both Big-O and Big-Omega)

`rate of growth` = how fast a function grows with the input size

[Complexity Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Orders_of_common_functions) (best to worst):
- constant (`O(1)`)
- logarithmic (`O(log n)`)
- polylogarithmic (`O(log n ^ c)`)
- linear (`O(n)`)
- n log-star n (`O(n log * n)`)
- linearthmic (`O(n log n)` `O(log n!)`)
- quadratic (`O(n^2)`)
- polynomial (`O(n^c)`)
- exponential (`2^O(n)`)
- factorial (`O(n!)`)
